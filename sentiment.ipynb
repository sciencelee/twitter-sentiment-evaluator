    "#### MY NOTES and research\n",
    "\n",
    "I started this project by doing all of the Deep NLP lessons at Flatiron in the appendix of Module 4\n",
    "This included:\n",
    "- Word embeddings\n",
    "- Word2vec\n",
    "- Sequence Models\n",
    "- Recurrant Neural Networks (RNN)\n",
    "- LSTM (Long Short term Membory) and GRU (Gated Recurrant Unit)\n",
    "\n",
    "I also did some code along and lab with word classifiers.\n",
    "RNN are good for time and sequenced classifications.  They can have vanishing and exploding gradient problems.  The modern equivalent to RNN is LSTM and GRU.  LSTM and GRU 'remember' and 'forget' data by feedback to the model throughout the sequence.  Gates keep only the most important info.  Neither is better, so you should try out both of them for these types of problems.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Other notes:\n",
    "We can train our own model, but there are ones out there that have been trained on all of wikipedia like GloVe which is what we will use here.  You can search for glove.6B.50d.txt to find the file.  It has all the weights and full dictionary of words.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is best to set up pipelines so we can run multiple model types.  We can use traditional tree based, SVC, or logistic regression models.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A Sequential NN with LSTM or GRU will likely work better for more complex tasks but will require more training and tuning time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The input layer has to be a RNN type to deal with sequential data, then you can set up traditional NN (Dense, pooling, dropout etc)"

    "### Project guidance\n",
    "The Flatiron curriculum had this as an optional project, and that's why I'm trying it to build some skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is from the instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "If you choose this option, you'll build an NLP model to analyze Twitter sentiment about Apple and Google products. The dataset comes from CrowdFlower via data.world. Human raters rated the sentiment in over 9,000 Tweets as positive, negative, or neither.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to:\n",
    "\n",
    "Build a model that can rate the sentiment of a Tweet based on its content.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aim for a Proof of Concept\n",
    "There are many approaches to NLP problems - start with something simple and iterate from there. For example, you could start by limiting your analysis to positive and negative Tweets only, allowing you to build a binary classifier. Then you could add in the neutral Tweets to build out a multiclass classifier. You may also consider using some of the more advanced NLP methods in the Mod 4 Appendix.\n",
